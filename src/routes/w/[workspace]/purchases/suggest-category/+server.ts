/**
 * Suggest a category for a purchase from its item name and merchant, as the Add
 * form's fields lose focus. A suggestion is never applied here; the client shows
 * it as a chip the person taps to accept.
 *
 * The thinking lives in `suggestCategory`, shared with the describe box. Note
 * what this no longer does: it used to bail out immediately when the assist was
 * off, because a model was the only thing it knew how to ask. The merchant
 * memory needs no model, so the question is worth asking either way — and with
 * AI off this is now the only category help in the app rather than none.
