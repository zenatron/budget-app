/**
 * Erase a workspace and everything under it, in one transaction.
 *
 * The schema declares no ON DELETE CASCADE, so rows have to go children-first or
 * a foreign key blocks the delete halfway. The order below is that dependency
 * graph read leaves-up; getting it wrong fails loudly rather than corrupting, so
 * it is safe to maintain, but it must stay complete — a new table that points at
 * the workspace and isn't listed here will wedge every future deletion.
 *
 * Blobs are intentionally left in place. They are content-addressed and
 * append-only (see BlobStore) — the app never deletes them even when a single
 * image is removed, both because identical bytes may be shared with another
 * workspace and because the store is meant to be backed up independently of the
 * DB. Orphaned blobs are harmless; a blob deleted out from under another
 * workspace's purchase is not.
