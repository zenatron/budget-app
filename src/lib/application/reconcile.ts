/**
 * Statement reconciliation: import a bank CSV, propose matches, let a person
 * confirm them.
 *
 * The point of this feature is to answer "is the ledger actually right?" — so
 * it is deliberately conservative about saying yes on your behalf. Importing
 * never creates, edits or deletes a purchase, and never moves an amount. The
 * only thing confirming a match writes is `purchase.cleared_at`: a mark meaning
 * "this appeared on a statement", which is reversible and carries no money.
 *
 * One deliberate exception, added with care: a person can turn an unmatched
 * line into a purchase (`createPurchaseFromLine`). It goes through the same
 * `submitPurchase` every hand-logged purchase does — approval policy, audit
 * event, notifications, all of it — and it refuses outright on an import whose
 * rows were read off a *picture* (`modelRead`): that would be the first path
 * putting a model-derived amount straight into the ledger, which is exactly
 * what the column was carried to prevent.
 *
 * Parsing lives in `domain/reconcile/parse-csv`, matching in
 * `domain/reconcile/match`; both are pure. This module is the I/O half.
