/**
 * Deterministic matching of bank-statement lines to recorded purchases.
 *
 * Pure TS, no I/O — the same discipline as the rest of `src/lib/domain`. It is
 * given already-parsed lines (see `parse-csv.ts`) and an already seal-filtered
 * candidate set, and returns a *proposal* per line. It never mutates anything.
 *
 * Two rules govern the whole module:
 *
 * 1. **A match is a proposal, never a conclusion.** Nothing here produces the
 *    `confirmed` state; the strongest verdict it can reach is `matched`, which
 *    the review screen shows as a suggestion for a person to accept. This is the
 *    same stance as the category assist on the new-purchase screen: suggest,
 *    never apply. Reconciliation touches what the ledger claims is true about
 *    money, so a heuristic must not be the last word.
 *
 * 2. **Ambiguity is reported, not resolved.** Two identical £4.20 coffees on the
 *    same day are genuinely indistinguishable from one bank line. Guessing one
 *    would be right half the time and silently wrong the other half, so an
 *    ambiguous line stays `unmatched` and carries its candidates for the person
 *    to pick from.
